# myPyGame
DigitalCrafts week 2 - pygame project

# Pygaman is a Megaman-inspired platformer, created as an exercise in learning Python, pygame, and Object-Oriented Programming.

# The three main objectives are as follows:

1. Provide the player with a character to control and a goal to reach.

2. Provide the player with a platform-based obstacle course full of enemies to traverse.

3. Provide the player with victory and loss endings for reaching or failing to reach the goal.
